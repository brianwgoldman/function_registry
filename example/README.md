# Example Usage

In this project we want users to be able to select greeting messages
and perform math operations. The initial work has produced two
types of greetings and two math operations, but obviously there
can be many more.

In order to add your own functions DO NOT MODIFY ANY OF OUR CODE.
Its ours. No touching. Just put your own .cpp and .h files
in this directory and add them to the compile command
(e.g. `g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp` will work). Make sure to add your
functions to the registry by putting calls to the
`REGISTER_FUNCTION` macro in your source files.
